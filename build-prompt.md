Based on your documents and goals, I understand you want to create a minimum viable prototype of a molecular Universal Turing Machine using pylua_bioxen_vm_lib, incorporating the social role personification approach (Librarian, Inspector, Foreman, etc.) from your research plan.

Here's the prompt you can use in your next session to create the project structure:

---

**Prompt for Next Session:**

"Please create a complete project structure for a molecular UTM MVP using pylua_bioxen_vm_lib. The project should implement the social role personification model with these key components:

**Core Molecular Workers:**
- Librarian (Tape/Memory management using Lua tables)
- Inspector (Head/Reader-Writer using Lua closures) 
- Foreman (State Machine/Transition rules using Lua closures)
- Shift Supervisor (Coroutine scheduler for parallel molecular reactions)
- Diplomatic Corps (FFI integration with C/C++ libraries)

**Project Requirements:**
- Use pylua_bioxen_vm_lib for VM management and interactive sessions
- Implement Chemical Reaction Network (CRN) parsing and execution
- Include benchmarking for NP-complete problems (TSP and 3-SAT)
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous execution modes
- Comprehensive testing framework using LuaUnit
- Integration with external C/C++ libraries via FFI
- Debug logging and performance monitoring

**Target Structure:**
```
molecular_utm_mvp/
├── src/molecular_workers/
├── src/crn_engine/
├── src/benchmarks/
├── tests/
├── examples/
├── config/
└── docs/
```

Create the complete directory structure with all necessary files, including placeholder Lua modules for each molecular worker, configuration files, test suites, and example implementations. Focus on the architectural foundation that supports the three-phase development roadmap from the research plan."

This prompt will give you a comprehensive starting structure for your molecular UTM prototype while staying within the session context limits.
